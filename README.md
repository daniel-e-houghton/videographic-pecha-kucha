Videographic Criticism using Chance Operations

by Mark Sample http://www.samplereality.com,
based on an idea by Jason Mittell http://justtv.wordpress.com

Inspired by the Pecha Kucha format, this program assembles
ten random 6-second clips from a single video
into a single 1-minute video, overlayed with a
randomly selected 60-second audio clip from the same video
